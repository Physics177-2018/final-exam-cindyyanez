When I tested my array of probabilities, I got an array of mostly zeroes and occassionally a one. That didn't sit right with me and since I kept getting errors beyond that part so I feel like I messed up with the periodic boundary conditions part. I didn't understand what I was doing wrong. "

Overall, I learned a lot in this course and I am really glad I took it. "
